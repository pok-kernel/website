POK is a real-time embedded operating system for safety-critical systems.
It relies on a micro-kernel architecture that isolates applications and 
drivers in time and space.
It is compatible with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_653">ARINC653</a>.
</p>

<p>
The kernel was designed to be very small and targets full
verification/certification: more than 90% of the kernel code if covered.
It currently runs on x86, PowerPC and Leon architectures.

<strong>Important security information (september 2018)</strong>
On September 12 2018, we have been made aware of a vulnerability in
POK by Stephane Duverger from Airbus Group CERT. Theres is the
description of the vulnerability:
<em>"
The POK micro-kernel is vulnerable to partition space segregation overflow vulnerability due to failure to properly validate user provided pointers during system calls.
As a consequence, a malicious user partition code is able to read and/or write out of the memory space dedicated to its partition."
</em>
We are currently working actively to provide a patch that will
be committed within the next few days. We wanted to
make the POK community aware of this issue. We would
like to thank Stephane for helping the POK community.
