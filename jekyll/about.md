# What is POK?

POK is a real-time embedded operating system for safety-critical systems
such as the one used in aerospace, avionics or nuclear applications.

POK relies on a micro-kernel that isolates device drivers and partitions
in time and space so that no application can overrun its resources budget.

POK has been used in several research project and one fork is now
used in commercial aircrafts.
